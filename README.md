# PyPool - Pool Aim Bot

We present an application to find all possible shots in a Pool game state that would pot balls of the desired
style. This system takes in an RGB video feed of the pool table from the playerâ€™s
perspective and produces a visual overlay that indicates possible shots. We envision this being used as an Augmented Reality system, which informs the player of the best shots available.

We implement this project using Python, mainly utilizing the OpenCV and PyTorch frameworks.
